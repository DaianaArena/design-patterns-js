# Design Patterns in JS - Strategy

## About the Pattern:
The Strategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of interchangeable algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern allows a client to choose from a variety of algorithms or strategies to perform a particular task without changing the client's code.
## Purpose and Benefits:
The main purpose of the Strategy pattern is to promote flexibility and maintainability in code by separating the behavior (algorithm) from the main class. It allows you to change or swap out algorithms at runtime without altering the client code. This can be particularly useful when different variations of an algorithm need to be used in different contexts.

Benefits of using the Strategy pattern include:

- Code Reusability: The encapsulated algorithms can be reused across different parts of the application, reducing duplication and improving consistency.

- Easy Maintenance: Changing or adding new algorithms does not affect the existing code, making maintenance and updates more manageable.

- Open/Closed Principle: The Strategy pattern follows the open/closed principle, allowing you to extend the functionality of the application by adding new strategies without modifying existing code.

- Enhanced Testability: Because the algorithms are separate from the context class, it becomes easier to test them in isolation.
## Use Cases:
The Strategy pattern is suitable in scenarios where you have a class that needs to perform a particular task in multiple ways, depending on the situation or context. Some use cases include:

- Sorting Algorithms: In a sorting application, you might have various sorting algorithms like QuickSort, MergeSort, and BubbleSort. Using the Strategy pattern, you can encapsulate these algorithms and switch between them based on user preferences or data size.

- Payment Processing: In an e-commerce application, you can use the Strategy pattern to implement different payment strategies, such as credit card payments, PayPal, or cryptocurrency payments.

- File Compression: When dealing with file compression, you can have different compression algorithms like ZIP, RAR, or 7-Zip. The Strategy pattern helps in swapping between these algorithms.

- Logging Strategies: In a logging framework, different logging strategies like console logging, file logging, and database logging can be encapsulated using the Strategy pattern.


In JavaScript, you can implement the Strategy pattern using classes and interfaces. Each strategy algorithm is represented by a separate class that adheres to a common interface or base class. The context class holds a reference to the selected strategy and delegates the task to the strategy object.

Remember that the Strategy pattern is most useful when you anticipate variations in behavior that need to be accommodated without altering the client code.
