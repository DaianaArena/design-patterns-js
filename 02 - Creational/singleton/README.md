# Design Patterns in JS - Singleton

## About the Pattern:
<img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/content/singleton/singleton-comic-1-en.png" alt="singleton" />
Welcome to the section dedicated to the Singleton design pattern in JavaScript! The Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

## Purpose and Benefits:
The Singleton pattern is used when you want to ensure that a class has only one instance and that instance is easily accessible across the entire application. This can be useful in scenarios such as managing configuration settings, database connections, or resource-intensive objects.

## Use Cases:

- Database Connection: Ensuring there's only one connection to a database to prevent resource wastage.
- Logger: Creating a single logger instance to manage application-wide logging.
- Configuration Settings: Having a single point to manage application configuration settings.
