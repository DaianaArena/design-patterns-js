# Design Patterns in JS

## About the project:

Welcome to our project! If you're looking to level up your JavaScript programming skills and create more efficient, maintainable, and robust code, you've come to the right place! The JavaScript Design Patterns Repository is your go-to resource for learning and implementing design patterns in JavaScript.

## What are Design Patterns?
Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring problems in software design. They provide standardized templates for solving common coding challenges and enable you to build more organized, modular, and flexible codebases. By understanding and utilizing these patterns, you can enhance the structure of your applications, promote code reusability, and ultimately become a more skilled developer.

## What to Expect in This Repository
In this repository, you will find a comprehensive collection of various design patterns implemented using JavaScript. These patterns have been acquired through a combination of sources, including an in-depth Udemy course, which will be credited at the end of the documentation. Additionally, we've delved into various online resources to ensure a well-rounded understanding and implementation of these essential programming techniques. Each design pattern comes with:

- Explanation: A detailed overview of the pattern, including its purpose, benefits, and scenarios where it is most applicable.
- Code Examples: Clear and concise JavaScript code snippets that demonstrate how to implement the pattern step by step.
- Use Cases: Real-world examples of where the pattern can be effectively applied, helping you understand its practical significance.
- Best Practices: Tips and recommendations for using the pattern effectively while avoiding common pitfalls.

The repository is organized into different directories, each representing a category of design patterns:

- Creational Patterns: These patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, providing flexibility in creating objects in a way that suits your needs.
- Structural Patterns: Structural patterns deal with object composition and relationships between objects, aiming to form larger structures from individual parts.
- Behavioral Patterns: These patterns define the communication between objects and how they collaborate, enhancing the interaction between various components.


## Before Installation - System Requirements

Make sure your development environment meets the following requirements:

 - Node.js
 - MacOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported.


## Getting Started

First, install all the  dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```


Then, run the server:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
